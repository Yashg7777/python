'''Certainly! In Python, the pass statement is a null operation that does nothing.
   It's typically used as a placeholder where Python syntax requires a statement, 
   but no action needs to be taken. Here are some examples demonstrating the use of pass:
'''

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

for num in numbers:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print(num)  # Print even numbers
    else:
        pass  # Skip odd numbers



x=5
if x>5:
    pass  # Placeholder for the code block when condition is met
else:
    # Code block to be implemented for the else case
    pass  # Placeholder for the code block



while True:
    pass  # Placeholder for the loop body
